            <p id="project1-paragraph-description">The goal was to create an event and design a microsite with a unique
                feature that would bring added value to the user. As a lover of electronic music, I began by choosing an
                Electronic Dance Music (EDM) Festival as the type of event.

                <b class="project1-bold">Insight</b>
                <p>What people wanted most from their festival experience was to witness amazing live events alongside
                    their friends. However, certain factors they couldn't get around would occasionally inconvenience
                    them.

                <p>The unique features that would add the most value to users would be a Digitized Line-Up with
                    corresponding Artist Pages, as well as, an Interactive Dashboard where they can easily access the
                    things that are most important to them during the festival. The dashboard would include the
                    aforementioned features: Line-Up Schedule/Alert System, Friend Groups, Interactive Map, and
                    Emergency Button.
