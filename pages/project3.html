            <p id="project1-paragraph-description">After being tasked with incorporating a new feature into an app
                that’s already been highly accepted, I began thinking of different apps I could improve. Considering
                I’ve used and watched Instagram grow over the past 7 years, it felt natural that I should try to
                discover a way to add value to the lives of many Instagrammers like myself.

                <b class="project1-bold">Problem</b>
                <p>After extensive analysis, it was determined that everyone in the team was wacky. This lead to many
                    laughs, which detracted from the time alloted to finish the product. But after many hardships, the
                    team pulled through and created the best product of them all.</p>

                <p>The culmination of my efforts resulted in "Custom Feeds", which allow Instagrammers to organize the
                    accounts, tags, and places they already follow into separate feeds according to the topics they
                    want.

                    Once they've created the individual feeds, they can switch between them to access the content they
                    want to see when they want to see it.
